Panel 1
MAGNA CONVOY narrates over an image of BLUE BIG CONVOY vanquishing all foes.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
Long ago, the universe was protected by a legion known as the Primus Vanguard.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
Assembled from a multitude of dimensions, the Vanguard strode forth to take on villainous armies and multiversal intruders at the command of their Leader.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
Passed down from leader to leader across the generations was our greatest treasure: the Matrix Sword, whose light obliterated evil and brought peace to the universe. However…

Panel 2
Magna recounts the moment of his birth and the destruction of the MATRIX SWORD.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
A Blue Warrior named Straxus betrayed the Vanguard, plotting to set comrade against comrade using a rage virus.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
In the end, our Leader died, and the corps was utterly destroyed.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
We were deprived of our symbolic sword…

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
Having survived and been granted strength from our last leader himself, I hunted down Straxus to take back the blade.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
But the sword was destroyed…

Panel 3
CONVOBAT in Headmaster mode struggles with the broken sword and what’s probably been a massive overshare from Magna.

CONVOBAT
Please just wait!

CONVOBAT
I can’t take such a precious thing! I just couldn’t…

Page 2
Panel 1
Magna Convoy kneels before his new liege.

MAGNA CONVOY
No, I am not fit to hold it.

MAGNA CONVOY
This sword is a Leader’s symbol… and it should go to someone who deserves it.

CONVOBAT
But I…

Panel 2
It’s all a bit much for Convobat.

MAGNA CONVOY (offscreen)
Though you may be a clone of the previous leader created by Straxus, I believe you are entitled to inherit it, Convobat.

CONVOBAT
Well, erm…

Panel 3
Magna Convoy is more focused on his knightly duties.

MAGNA CONVOY
Now, come this way. I must repair your Transtector.

CONVOBAT
Ah… So…

MAGNA CONVOY
It’s a good thing the ship still functions. This being the case…

Panel 4-6
Magna has his train of thought interrupted by a sudden alert while Convobat notices they’re not alone, as two ROLLERMASTERS stare through the window!

MAGNA CONVOY
What the-?! This is… there’s evidence we’ve made contact with something… but what?

Page 3
Panel 1
Not just two Rollermasters, but a whole crowd of them!

MAGNA CONVOY
What?!

Panel 2
Outside, the entire ship is swarmed by Rollermasters!

MAGNA CONVOY (offscreen)
It’s the- the Rollermaster Corps!

Panel 3-Page 4
No need for translation here: Magna Convoy throws his shield out the window, raining laser fire on the drones before he himself bursts from the ship in vehicle mode, transforming as he does.

Page 5
Panel 1
Magna Convoy catches his gun mid-air, ready to fight.

MAGNA CONVOY
Magna Convoy, transform!

MAGNA CONVOY
Convobat! You need to leave, now! Take the ship while you can and escape!

Panel 4
Convobat doesn’t like this plan, but is interrupted by a shadow looming over Magna.

CONVOBAT
Just me?! No, I couldn’t-! Magna Convoy, behind you!

Panel 5
Magna wheels around and shoots.

MAGNA CONVOY
What?!

Page 6
Panel 1
The shot hits its mark, but STRAXUS powers through!

STRAXUS
I’ve finally found you, wasted scrap! How very convenient that you both ran all the way to Gaea here!

Panel 2
Straxus and Magna Convoy clash.

STRAXUS
You won’t be lonely in death: I’ll kill you both!

MAGNA CONVOY
Straxus!

Panel 3
Magna knocks Straxus back.

MAGNA CONVOY
You bastard… You won’t get away with this!

Panel 4
Magna is mad as hell.

MAGNA CONVOY
Not just my comrades… I lost everything to you!

MAGNA CONVOY
But! I still have one thing left to hold on to! And I’ll sacrifice my very life to keep it safe!

Panel 5
Convobat is shocked by Magna’s words.

MAGNA CONVOY (offscreen)
He is… the last light!

Panel 6
Naturally, Straxus doesn’t care.

STRAXUS
If you say so…

Page 7
Panel 1

STRAXUS
Then you can join your fealty in the grave!

MAGNA CONVOY
Graagh!

Go to hell!

STRAXUS
What?!

CONVOBAT
Magna Convoy! This is yours!

MAGNA CONVOY
!

Page 8
Panel 1-2
Magna Convoy is speechless, while Straxus keeps the pressure on.

STRAXUS
Rollermaster Corps! Kill them both!

Panel 3-4
Convobat clips his swords onto the rocket shield, using it as a kind of flying blade sled and cutting a swathe through the Rollermasters.

CONVOBAT
I’m borrowing this!

Panel 5
Convobat gives a pep talk as he flies around.

CONVOBAT
You’re the one who should have that sword! Who was it entrusted to in the first place? You!

Panel 6
Magna Convoy is extremely gruff.

CONVOBAT
Isn’t that enough?!

MAGNA CONVOY
Why are you still here?! I told you to run!

Page 9
Panel 1
Convobat has a moment remembering MEGALLIGATOR.

CONVOBAT
You remind me of my friend. Not in terms of looks… But you have this stubborn attitude where you stick to your decisions while ignoring the people around you… You’re obnoxious.

CONVOBAT
I don’t like that part about him either. So…

Panel 2
The Rollermasters lumber in to attack.

CONVOBAT (offscreen)
So I refuse to listen to you as well!

Panel 3
Convobat blocks another attack from the drones.

CONVOBAT
Ugh!

MAGNA CONVOY
Convobat!

Panel 4
Convobat holds the shield up, clearly having a tough time.

CONVOBAT
If you want to protect me, then I must ask this favour of you!

Panel 5
Straxus isn’t impressed.

STRAXUS
Your wearing of your beloved commander’s mask means nothing.

Panel 6
Close up on Magna Convoy, deep in a crisis of confidence.

STRAXUS
Do you really think you can accomplish anything with that dreg of a blade?

Panel 7-8
Straxus punctuates his rant with a round of laser fire.

STRAXUS
We told you, didn’t we? Of the garbage sentient beings hold in their heads… And yet…

STRAXUS
You don’t even have the ambition or strength needed to utilise the nonsense you peddle!

STRAXUS
So we say that we shall lead you into the coming future! Either obey… or die!

Page 10
Panels 1-4
Straxus blasts Magna Convoy, horrifying Convobat. But there’s a glint in the smoke…

CONVOBAT
Magna Convoy!

Panel 5
The smoke clears, and Magna Convoy has blocked the blast with the Matrix Sword.

MAGNA CONVOY
I have been entrusted…

MAGNA CONVOY
With him… with a fragment by the name of “hope”…

Panel 6-7
Magna Convoy prays to the sword, and his destroyed hand begins to glow…

MAGNA CONVOY
I don’t even know if I have the right to ask…

MAGNA CONVOY
But just this once… Give me the strength to protect him!

MAGNA CONVOY
…O light!

Page 11

O Matrix Sword!

Guh…

STRAXUS
Damn it… I’m going to kill them…

Hey, dullards! Get me up already…

Page 13

Convobat wants to know what comes next.

CONVOBAT
What are you going to do now?

Panel 4
Magna Convoy on the bridge.

Those who could tell their story, the books that recorded them, all gone… The legend is over.

MAGNA CONVOY (v.o.)
But now, the light is being weaved again.

Magna Convoy’s in for the long haul.

MAGNA CONVOY
I wonder, would you come with me?

Page 14

Woven… into a Blue Order.

BLUDGEON
It appears the Blue has finally awoken.

BLUDGEON
The inheritors of the Seven Lights divided from The One have begun to make themselves known.

Bludgeon rejoices as he monitors various persons of interest. All proceeds according to plan.

BLUDGEON
A new era… is upon us.

Translation Notes
Compared to his previous appearance, Magna Convoy at first speaks in a much more formal register with the always-polite Convobat, believing him to be his liege. He continues to be harsh when speaking with Straxus, but in the last pages of the comic he takes a casual tone with Convobat, most likely seeing himself as an equal with his former leader’s clone.

Magna Convoy remarks on the continued functioning of the spaceship Sentinel. He uses the word ikiteiru (生きている), which can be used to describe a machine functioning. However, the word can also mean “to be alive”, and there is likely a double meaning: judging by a panel showing a robotic blueprint with a floating head, Magna appears to be realising that the ship is in fact a still-living robot. This robot, Omega Sentinel, would later appear in the chronologically-earlier Generations Selects Super Megatron comic.

Interestingly, Straxus gives the name of the planet that this comic and Cybertron Convobat took place on as “Gaea”, but only in the official English translation! In the Japanese, it’s referred to only as “this planet” (konna hoshi).

As of yet, no fiction has followed up on the series of massive teases on the last page. I recommend checking out TFwiki’s coverage of this comic for a handy breakdown of all the people Bludgeon’s been creeping on.
